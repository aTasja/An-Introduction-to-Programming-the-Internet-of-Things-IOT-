# Build a circuit using your Raspberry Pi that causes an LED to blink when a push button is NOT pressed. 
# However, the LED should stay on continually when the push button IS pressed.

# Your video should show the LED blinking when the push button is not pressed, 
# and it should show that the LED is constantly on while the button is pressed.
