//Write a program that causes the built-in LED connected to pin 13 on the Arduino 
//to blink, alternating between fast blinks and slow blinks. 
//The LED should blink 5 times, once every half second, and then it should blink 5 more times, 
//once every two seconds. The LED should continue to blink in this alternating fashion for as long as the Arduino receives power.

//If you do not have an Arduino, you can use the web-based Arduino simulator at 123d.circuits.io. 
//You will need to create an account for free. There are instructional videos on that website that 
//will teach you how to use the simulator. 

void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {

  int n;
  for (n = 0; n<5; n++){      // for 5 times:
  	digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  	delay(500);               // wait for a half second
  	digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  	delay(250);               // wait for a half second
  }
  for (n = 0; n<5; n++){      // for 5 times:
  	digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  	delay(2000);              // wait for 2 seconds
  	digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  	delay(250);               // wait for 2 seconds
  }
