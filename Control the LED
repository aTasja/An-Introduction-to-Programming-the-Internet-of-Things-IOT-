//Write a program that allows the user to control the LED connected to pin 13 of the Arduino. 
//When the program is started, the LED should be off. The user should open the serial monitor 
//to communicate with the Arduino. If the user sends the character '1' through the serial monitor 
//then the LED should turn on. If the user sends the character '0' through the serial monitor then the LED should turn off.

//If you do not have an Arduino, you can use the web-based Arduino simulator at 123d.circuits.io. 
//You will need to create an account for free. There are instructional videos on that website that 
//will teach you how to use the simulator.
