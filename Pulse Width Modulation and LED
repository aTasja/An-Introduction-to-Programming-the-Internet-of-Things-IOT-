# Connect an LED to your Raspberry Pi and write a program to gradually increase brightness, 
# and then gradually decrease brightness. The exact rate of increase and decrease is not critical 
# but let it take at least one second to go from maximum to minimum brightness. 
# Be sure to use pulse width modulation to change the brightness of the LED. 
# Also, be sure to wire the LED in series with an appropriate resistor so that it does not receive too much current.
